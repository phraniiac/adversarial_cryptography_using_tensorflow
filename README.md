# Implementation of Adversarial Neural Crytography

This is a implementation of [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06918.pdf) published by Google Brain team.
This repo contains the code in crypt.py made using Tensorflow version 1.0rc on python3. Also the summary of a
run is present in tf_summary, which can be used using the command - 

`tensorboard --logdir=./tf_summary/crypto/1/`

Some of the visualizations created are below.
